MiMeMo.BarentsSea
=================

This page details at a broad level the code written to extract data and
parameterise StrathE2E*Polar* as part of MiMeMo. You can find
information on the depedencies, runtimes, and tasks performed by each of
the scripts. Scripts are loosely classified into families - *bathymetry*
- *fish* - *flows* - *nemo-medusa* - *saltless* - *StrathE2E*. These can
all be run from a master script, with a region file allowing the user to
define the model domain for data extraction.

Script Objectives
-----------------

In the future I plan to detail blow by blow what exactly each script
does. This will likely take the form of a dropdown list of vignettes on
this website. As there are about 40 scripts at the moment this isnâ€™t
going to happen immediately. For now this section is here to briefly
mention the purpose of each script.
